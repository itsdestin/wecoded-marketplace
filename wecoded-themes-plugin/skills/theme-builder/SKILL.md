description: Build immersive YouCoded theme packs. Invoke as /theme-builder "your vibe description". Users can start from a general vibe, a specific detailed brief, or by uploading their own wallpaper. Three-phase — concept browser, then Kit refinement (swap palette/layout/bubble/font/effects/wallpaper/mascots/icons per column), then theme pack finalization.

# /theme-builder

Build a custom YouCoded theme pack. Three starting modes:

- **General vibe** — short prompt like "cozy autumn", "cyberpunk", "Hello Kitty". Claude designs from scratch.
- **Specific detailed description** — longer brief covering palette, fonts, layout, mood, references. Claude follows precisely.
- **Upload your own wallpaper** — user drops in an image and Claude builds the theme around it.

Three-phase flow:
1. **Concept browser** — Claude generates 3 options in a browser window (no app changes)
2. **Kit refinement** — user picks one; lands on a single-page builder where palette / chrome / bubble / font / effects / wallpaper / mascots / icons are swappable columns
3. **Build** — finalize pack (folder with manifest + assets); app hot-reloads

## Reference files (load on demand)

Stay out of context until needed:

- `reference/concept-card.md` — concept card HTML structure, app-mockup data attributes, glassmorphism vars. **Read before generating Phase 1 concepts.**
- `reference/tokens.md` — contrast rules, palette temperature, effect intensity, layout preset notes. **Read before designing a palette from scratch or writing a palette override.** Skip if applying a Kit preset unmodified.
- `reference/mascots.md` — mascot art palette (not button inversion), restrained lighting, face/body and silhouette/background checks at 24/48/80/112 px across all eight expressions. **Read before generating or recolouring any mascot SVG.**
- `reference/phase2-finalize.md` — full Phase 2 build steps (folder promote, terminal-bg bake, manifest, custom CSS, contrast validation). **Read when processing a `kit-build` event.**

---

## Wallpaper recommendation (ask early)

Most themes use a wallpaper. **Always recommend the user provide their own** — saves tokens and speeds things up. Ask upfront before generating concepts. Then:

- **User provides one wallpaper** — use as the visual anchor for all 3 concepts. Differentiate concepts through palette, overlay tint, and effects — not by swapping the wallpaper.
- **User wants Claude to find them** — **narrow the direction first.** A prompt like "KPop Demon Hunters" or "Studio Ghibli" branches many ways. Searching blindly wastes a second round course-correcting. Instead:

  **Medium default (tell the user):** Unless the prompt explicitly calls for photography (e.g. "real photo", "photograph", "photorealistic"), default to non-photographic art — illustration, digital painting, sketch, watercolor, or animation stills. Before proposing directions, say something like: *"I'll default to illustrated/artistic styles rather than real photos — let me know if you'd prefer photography instead."*

  1. Sketch the axes that actually vary for this prompt. Typical ones: **Medium** (illustration / digital painting / watercolor / sketch / animation still — default; or realistic photo if user directs), **Tone** (dark / bright / neon), **Subject** (main character / full cast / environment / abstract), **Scene energy** (action / atmospheric / iconic pose).
  2. Propose **3 starting directions** as named bundles (e.g. *"A — main character, dark action; B — full cast, bright promo; C — environment, atmospheric"*). Two axes per bundle is enough. Each bundle should reflect the art-first default in its medium unless overridden.
  3. Wait for user to pick, merge, or override. Only then search.

  After confirm, download **3 separate wallpapers** (one per concept) before rendering concepts.

  **Use `scripts/fetch-wallpaper.cjs`.** Handles CDN hot-link protection (stock-image sites return ~20 KB placeholder without correct Referer + User-Agent) and gallery pages (extracts `og:image` and fetches that). Usage: `node scripts/fetch-wallpaper.cjs <url> <out-path>`.

  **1080p rule:** every wallpaper ≥ 1920×1080 (either orientation). `fetch-wallpaper.cjs` rejects sub-HD with a JSON error; on rejection, search for a higher-res source.

  Skip narrowing if the prompt already pins medium + tone + subject (e.g. "dark noir black-and-white Blade Runner street").

## Phase 1 — Concept Browser

> **`${SKILL}` in this file** means this skill's own directory — the one
> containing `SKILL.md`. Resolve it once (the skill lives under the installed
> plugin, e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/youcoded/plugins/wecoded-themes-plugin/skills/theme-builder`)
> and use it for every path below. These paths previously read
> `core/skills/theme-builder/...`, a layout that has not existed since the
> WeCoded rebrand — every command in this file silently pointed at nothing.

### Step 1: Start the Visual Companion Server

```bash
bash "${SKILL}/scripts/start-server.sh" --project-dir ~/.claude/wecoded-themes
```

Use `run_in_background: true`. Read the `server-info` file after 3 seconds.

`--project-dir` does double duty: it's where the session dir lives AND where the
live preview writes (`<project-dir>/_preview`). Point it at
`~/.claude/wecoded-themes` unless you're testing, in which case a scratch dir
keeps the user's real app out of it entirely.

### Step 2: Stage Assets for Preview Server

```bash
cp ${SKILL}/theme-preview.css        "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/kit-page.css     "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/helper.js        "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/mockup-render.js "${screen_dir}/"
```

`layout-gallery.html` is deliberately NOT staged. It is an orphan — nothing
links to it, no step serves it, and it still advertises the `terminal` chrome
option that was removed on 2026-07-19. Copying it into every session put a stale
page one URL guess away from the user. The file is kept, unstaged, pending a
decision on whether a standalone layout chooser is still wanted.

`mockup-render.js` is REQUIRED — `concept-page-template.html` loads it and every
`.app-mockup` renders blank without it. It was missing from this list until
2026-07-19, so the first concept page of every session came up empty.

`kit-page.css` is REQUIRED here too: the concept page uses the same `--ui-*`
chrome as the Kit so Phase 1 and Phase 1.5 read as one product. Load order
matters — `theme-preview.css` first, `kit-page.css` second.

All HTML links CSS via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/theme-preview.css">` — do NOT embed CSS inline. All asset refs in HTML use the `/files/` prefix (bare filenames 404).

### Step 3: Determine Prompt Mode (automatic — never ask)

- **Brand/IP Mode** — references a recognizable character, brand, franchise, or product. Research-first; brand fidelity paramount.
- **Vibe/Abstract Mode** — aesthetic, mood, setting, abstract concept. Creative-first; freedom to invent.

### Step 4: Generate 3 Theme Concepts

**Before designing, read two files in parallel:**

```
scripts/concept-page-template.html    — page shell to fill in
reference/concept-card.md             — tab + panel markup, mockup data-attrs
```

Those two are sufficient. Deliberately NOT read here:

- `scripts/app-mockup-chrome.html` (~7KB) — it is the STRUCTURAL SPEC of chrome
  you must never hand-write. `mockup-render.js` injects all of it at runtime and
  `concept-card.md` documents the `data-*` contract you actually author. Open it
  only if you are changing `mockup-render.js` itself.
- `scripts/manifest-template.jsonc` (~5KB) — concepts carry tokens as inline CSS
  vars, not manifest JSON. Read it at Step 5 when you seed `_preview`, which is
  the first time a manifest exists.

That is ~12KB not read before a single design decision, on a path that used to
read the same `data-mockup` contract from three different files.

**Optional but recommended:** browse `scripts/palettes/*.json` for pre-validated 15-token starter kits. If one matches the vibe, start from it and tweak — faster, less likely to fail contrast.

Design **3 genuinely different interpretations** — not 3 tints of the same concept.

**Differentiator rule:** each concept MUST differ from the others on **at least 2** of {palette family, layout preset, font character, bubble shape, primary decorative effect}. Three concepts sharing everything except palette = one concept in three tints — regenerate.

For each concept, decide: palette (15 tokens, see `reference/tokens.md`), shape radius, font (Google or system — set `--font-sans` + `--font-mono`, add `<link>` in `<head>`), background (solid / gradient / image — if wallpapers downloaded, each concept uses its own), layout presets, effects, pattern overlay, icon overrides, mascot crossover plan, custom CSS effects.

### Step 4b: Write the Page

Fill the template and write it to **`${screen_dir}/screen.html`**:

- `<!-- PAGE_TITLE -->` — e.g. `Cyberpunk — 3 Concepts`
- `<!-- GOOGLE_FONTS -->` — one `<link>` per concept font
- `<!-- CONCEPT_TABS -->` — one `.c-tab` per concept (name, swatches, one-line vibe)
- `<!-- CONCEPT_CARDS -->` — one `.c-card` per concept, each holding ONLY its
  `.c-stage` + `.app-mockup`. See `reference/concept-card.md` for both shapes.

Nothing is served until this file exists — the server serves the newest `.html`
in `screen_dir`, so a session that stages assets but never writes the page shows
the user an empty waiting screen.

### Step 5: Tell the User + Quick-Apply

Tell user the URL. They pick a concept by clicking a card — server logs a `choice` event. On pick, immediately seed a minimal `_preview`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/wecoded-themes/_preview
```

Write `manifest.json` with tokens, shape, layout, effects, font from the selected concept — no asset paths yet. App auto-switches to `_preview` and auto-reverts when the folder is deleted, so the user sees the theme live while Kit-refining.

> **Slug invariant (critical — silent failure):** Manifest's internal `"slug"` field MUST be `"_preview"` during Kit phase, matching the directory name. The renderer keys hot-reload auto-switch off the directory name, then looks up the loaded theme by its internal `.slug`. If they don't match (e.g. you used the final slug like `"strawberry-kitty"` while the folder is still `_preview`), auto-switch fires but resolves to the default built-in theme instead — the app appears to silently ignore the preview. Only rename the slug field to its final value in Phase 2 when you move the folder.

Then move to Phase 1.5 (Kit) instead of open-ended chat iteration. Keep the concept browser URL in case the user asks to revisit alternates.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Kit Refinement

User lands on the **Kit** — one page with eight swappable columns. Primary authoring surface; most refinement happens here, not in chat.

| Column | Kind | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Palette | preset + override | Swap the 15-token color set |
| Chrome & Layout | preset + override | `chrome-style` / `input-style` / `header-style` / `statusbar-style` |
| Bubble Style | preset + override | `bubble-style` preset |
| Font | preset + override | Swap Google Font, auto-linked on rebuild |
| Effects | multi + override | Particles (pick one) + overlay textures (vignette / noise / scanlines) |
| Wallpaper | review + override | Keep hero image, or describe a change |
| Mascots | review + override | Keep the generated set, or describe changes |
| Icons & Details | review + override | Keep icon overrides / cursor / scrollbar, or describe changes |

### Step 5a: Generate Baseline Assets

Before rendering Kit, generate the assets Kit needs in review columns. Write into `_preview/assets/` (so live app hot-loads them) AND copy to `screen_dir` (so Kit references via `/files/`).

> **Write order matters — manifest LAST.** Assets first, manifest second. The chokidar watcher fires a reload per file; if the manifest exists before all assets, the reload reads it and the app briefly renders with broken asset URLs. Writing manifest last lets the debounce collapse everything to one clean event after all files are present.

1. **Hero wallpaper** — copy chosen concept's wallpaper to `_preview/assets/wallpaper.<ext>` and `${screen_dir}/wallpaper.<ext>`.
2. **Mascots** (if theme has them) — **read `reference/mascots.md` before generating.** Do not draw them: run `node scripts/build-mascot.mjs --out _preview/assets --config <palette.json>`, which writes the rig and all four flat variants at once, then decorate the slots. Mirror the flat variants into `screen_dir`. Kit iterates on the palette and the decoration; the geometry never changes.
3. **Icon overrides** — only the slots the concept calls for. `_preview/assets/icon-<slot>.svg` + mirror.
4. **Pattern SVG** — only if concept has a pattern. `_preview/assets/pattern.svg` + mirror.
5. **Manifest LAST** — `_preview/manifest.json` with relative asset paths. Omit mascot / icon / pattern sections if not used — matching Kit columns hide themselves automatically.

### Verify the preview activated

After writing the manifest, tell the user: "The app should auto-switch to the preview. If you don't see it apply within a few seconds, say so." Don't assume success — silent activation failure is the most common way this skill has broken historically.

Fallback if user reports no change: **rename `_preview` → final-slug immediately** (skip Kit refine). Promotes the theme into the picker so they can select manually. Loses auto-hot-reload but gets a working theme. Symptoms:

- Older packaged build (pre-chokidar fix) — `fs.watch` misses new subdirs on Windows
- Manifest slug field ≠ directory name (`_preview`) — renderer falls back to default. Now warned in DevTools console — ask user to check.
- Watcher event fired before renderer mounted its listener — race condition

### Step 5b: Stage the Kit Page

**Copy every file verbatim. There are no placeholders to fill.**

```bash
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/kit-refinement-template.html "${screen_dir}/screen.html"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/kit-presets.json   "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/kit-page.css       "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/kit-page.js        "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/kit-state.js       "${screen_dir}/"
cp ${SKILL}/scripts/contrast-rules.js  "${screen_dir}/"
# Palette presets are served individually so the page can apply one on click.
for f in ${SKILL}/scripts/palettes/*.json; do
  b=$(basename "$f" .json); [ "$b" = "README" ] || cp "$f" "${screen_dir}/palette-$b.json"
done
```

Then write ONE file: **`${screen_dir}/kit-state.json`** (schema below).

That's the whole job. The page renders itself from `kit-state.json` +
`kit-presets.json` at load. Until 2026-07-19 this step meant hand-filling ~20
placeholders in a ~24KB document, and every subsequent tweak meant rewriting the
whole thing; the page is now static and you write ~1.2KB of JSON instead.

**Never edit the HTML to change a theme.** If you find yourself doing that,
you're fighting the design — change `kit-state.json`.

### The `kit-state.json` schema

kit-state is a **theme manifest plus a `_kit` block** — not a parallel schema.
`kit-state.js` turns it into a manifest by stripping `_kit`, forcing the slug,
and prefixing asset paths. Keeping the shapes identical means there's only one
thing to keep in sync.

```jsonc
{
  "_kit": {
    "version": 1,
    "revision": 1,               // BUMP THIS whenever you rewrite the file. The
                                 // page keeps the user's in-progress edits in
                                 // sessionStorage across the reloads your asset
                                 // writes trigger, and only lets your version
                                 // win when revision is newer. Forget it and a
                                 // regenerated wallpaper is silently discarded.
    "themeName": "Ivory Schematic",
    "finalSlug": "ivory-schematic",  // Phase-2 target. NEVER write this as `slug`.

    // FOUR palettes YOU derive from this theme's wallpaper. These are the
    // primary palette cards; kit-presets.json's stock six sit behind a "Show
    // stock palettes" disclosure. Generate them — a stock palette almost never
    // suits a specific image, which is the whole reason this field exists.
    // Give them genuinely different readings of the SAME image (e.g. light
    // paper / dark archival / cool neutral / low-contrast soft), not four
    // tints of one idea. Each needs the full 15 tokens, and each MUST pass
    // `check-contrast.cjs --tokens-json -` before you write it.
    //
    // DON'T hand-tune the five text tokens to make that pass. Pick surfaces and
    // accent for character, put any plausible text ramp in, and let
    // `check-contrast.cjs <manifest> --fix` place the ramp — it solves in OKLCH
    // against every surface the app paints on, including the glass composite.
    // Hand-picking tokens and grading them afterwards is exactly what shipped
    // unreadable secondary text in all 11 themes (2026-07-19); `fg-faint` had
    // never once passed on a raised surface in any theme that ever shipped.
    // If --fix reports UNSATISFIABLE, the surface ladder is too wide — move
    // canvas/panel/inset/well closer together; no text colour can rescue it.
    "customPalettes": [
      { "id": "wp-ivory", "name": "Ivory Field",
        "blurb": "Paper cream and bronze, straight from the sketch",
        "swatches": ["#EDE8DD","#E3DCCB","#D2C6AA","#7A5A2E","#2B2318"], // canvas,panel,inset,accent,fg
        "tokens": { /* all 15 */ } }
      // …three more
    ],

    "selected": { "palette": "wp-ivory", "chrome": "default",
                  "bubble": "bordered", "font": "nunito", "particles": "ember" },
    "reviewAssets": { "wallpaper": "wallpaper.jpeg", "mascots": [], "icons": {} },
    "scanlineIntensity": 1       // multiplier on the 0.08 CSS base
  },

  "name": "Ivory Schematic",
  "slug": "_preview",            // literal, always, while previewing
  "dark": false,
  "tokens": { /* all 15 */ },
  "shape":  { "radius": "4px", "radius-sm": "4px", "radius-md": "6px",
              "radius-lg": "10px", "radius-full": "9999px" },
  "font":   { "family": "'Space Grotesk', 'Cascadia Mono', monospace",
              "google-font-url": "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=..." },
  "background": { "type": "image", "value": "wallpaper.jpeg",  /* BASENAME */
                  "panels-blur": 10, "panels-opacity": 0.78,
                  "bubble-blur": 8, "bubble-opacity": 0.9 },
  "layout": { "chrome-style": "default", "input-style": "default",
              "bubble-style": "bordered", "header-style": "default",
              "statusbar-style": "default" },
  "effects": { "particles": "ember", "vignette": 0.12, "noise": 0, "scan-lines": false },
  "custom_css": "::selection { background: rgba(122,90,46,0.3); }"
}
```

**Asset paths are BARE BASENAMES.** The two consumers need different prefixes —
`assets/` for the manifest the app reads, `/files/` for the preview server — so
the transform adds them. Writing `assets/wallpaper.jpeg` here yields
`assets/assets/wallpaper.jpeg`.

### Step 5c: Handle Kit requests

**There is no Rebuild button and no `kit-submit` event.** Presets, colour
pickers and sliders apply live in the browser and write the live preview
themselves. You are only involved for work the page cannot do:

| Event | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `{"type":"kit-request","kind":"wallpaper","note":"...","state":{…}}` | needs new art | fetch via `fetch-wallpaper.cjs`, write to `_preview/assets/` + `screen_dir`, bump `_kit.revision`, rewrite `kit-state.json` |
| `…"kind":"mascots"` | redraw mascots | read `reference/mascots.md`, re-run `build-mascot.mjs` with the new palette, same write pattern |
| `…"kind":"icons"` | redraw icons | regenerate the named slots, same write pattern |
| `{"type":"kit-build","state":{…}}` | ship it | Phase 2 — **read `reference/phase2-finalize.md`** |

Events appear in server stdout as `{"source":"user-event", …}`. Read the server
log to see them.

`kit-build` carries the FINAL state, so Phase 2 is one read and one write rather
than reconstructing anything.

**Escape hatch:** if the user asks to "show me more options," copy
`concept-page-template.html` back over `screen.html` and regenerate concepts.
Default flow stays on Kit.

---

## Phase 2 — Finalize & Ship

When the Kit user clicks **Build Theme Pack** (the page sends `{"type":"kit-build","state":{…}}`), **read `reference/phase2-finalize.md`** and follow its steps: folder promote, terminal-bg bake, manifest write, custom CSS write, contrast validate, confirm to user, delete `_preview`.

Most assets already exist in `_preview/assets/` from Phase 1.5 — Phase 2 is mostly `cp` operations; only regenerate what's missing.

**Mascot rig (if the theme has mascots):** `build-mascot.mjs` already wrote
`assets/mascot-rig.svg` alongside the flat variants in Phase 1.5 — copy it across and make
sure the manifest's `mascot` section names all five. Flat variants stay: the rig is
desktop-only, and Android and remote browsers render the flat art.

---

## Phase 3 — In-App Refinement

After the pack is written, refinements go directly to manifest or asset files; app hot-reloads. See "Phase 3" section in `reference/phase2-finalize.md` for common refinement patterns.

---

## Rules

- NEVER modify files in `src/renderer/themes/builtin/` or write to any path inside the app bundle
- All asset paths in manifest.json MUST be relative
- Use `custom_css` for effects the schema doesn't cover
- NEVER set `border-radius` on bubble elements in `custom_css` — use `bubble-style` preset and `shape` values
- Pattern SVGs must tile seamlessly; particle shapes must work at 8–16 px
- Never hand-draw a mascot — run `scripts/build-mascot.mjs` and decorate its slots. The four hand-drawn starter templates were deleted 2026-09-05: they carried React attribute spelling that is invalid in SVG, so all four rendered as black silhouettes and one had a single eye.
- Preview CSS (`theme-preview.css`) and app's `globals.css` are a CONTRACT — if either changes, both must stay in sync
- NEVER write the concepts page HTML from scratch — always read `scripts/concept-page-template.html` first and fill placeholders
- NEVER write or edit the Kit page HTML. Copy `scripts/kit-refinement-template.html` VERBATIM and write `kit-state.json` instead — the page renders itself from JSON at load. Editing the markup to change a theme means you've misread the design.

---

## Phase Checklists

**Before rendering concepts (Phase 1):**
- [ ] `scripts/concept-page-template.html` and `reference/concept-card.md` have been read
- [ ] Each `.app-mockup` uses `data-mockup` + data-* placeholders — NO inlined chrome HTML, NO hand-drawn icons (`mockup-render.js` injects canonical chrome at runtime)
- [ ] Concepts differ on ≥ 2 of {palette family, layout preset, font character, bubble shape, primary effect}
- [ ] All asset references use `/files/` prefix; CSS linked not inlined
- [ ] Glassmorphism mockups set all four glass vars: `--panels-blur`, `--panels-opacity`, `--bubble-blur`, `--bubble-opacity`
- [ ] Wallpaper concepts: `--panels-opacity` ≤ 0.85 so the wallpaper bleeds through chrome
- [ ] Concept palette piped through `check-contrast.cjs --tokens-json -` — passes HARD rules before HTML is written
- [ ] `on-accent` passes 4.5:1 against `accent`

**Before rendering Kit (Phase 1.5):**
- [ ] Concept pick seeded into `_preview/manifest.json` (tokens + shape + layout + font + effects)
- [ ] Baseline assets generated into BOTH `_preview/assets/` AND `screen_dir`: wallpaper, mascots (if applicable), icons (if applicable), pattern (if applicable)
- [ ] Mascots (if generated) came from `build-mascot.mjs`, not hand-drawn
- [ ] All SEVEN page files copied VERBATIM into `screen_dir`: `kit-refinement-template.html`→`screen.html`, `kit-presets.json`, `kit-page.css`, `kit-page.js`, `kit-state.js`, `contrast-rules.js`, and `palettes/*.json` as `palette-<id>.json`
- [ ] `kit-state.json` written — `slug` is the literal `"_preview"`, `_kit.finalSlug` holds the real one, asset values are BARE BASENAMES
- [ ] `_kit.customPalettes` holds FOUR wallpaper-derived palettes, each with all 15 tokens, each contrast-checked, each a genuinely different reading of the image — not four tints of one
- [ ] The page shows a loading screen until `kit-state.json` exists and parses, so it's safe to hand over the URL before you've finished writing assets
- [ ] NO placeholders filled and NO markup edited — if you edited the HTML, you're doing it wrong

**When handling a kit-request (Phase 1.5):**
- [ ] Only the requested slice regenerated — the page handles everything else itself
- [ ] Any new palette piped through `check-contrast.cjs --tokens-json -` (see `reference/tokens.md`)
- [ ] Updated assets mirrored into BOTH `_preview/assets/` AND `screen_dir`
- [ ] `_kit.revision` BUMPED before rewriting `kit-state.json` — without it the page keeps its sessionStorage copy and your new asset is silently discarded

**Before finalizing theme pack (Phase 2):**
- [ ] A `kit-build` event arrived — the user explicitly clicked Build, don't infer it
- [ ] `reference/phase2-finalize.md` has been read
- [ ] **`_kit` block deleted from the manifest** — it is Kit bookkeeping, not theme data
- [ ] **`slug` changed from `"_preview"` to the final slug**, matching the folder name — mismatch makes the app silently render the built-in default
- [ ] **Every asset path prefixed `assets/`** — kit-state stores bare basenames (`background.value`, `background.pattern`, all `mascot.*`, all `icons.*`)
- [ ] **Wallpaper copied under the name in `background.value`**, not a hardcoded `wallpaper.<ext>` — user uploads are named `wallpaper-user-<id>.<ext>`
- [ ] `scripts/manifest-template.jsonc` read before writing manifest.json
- [ ] `scripts/custom-css-reference.md` read before writing custom CSS
- [ ] Assets moved from `_preview/assets/` → `<slug>/assets/`; wallpaper also still in `screen_dir`
- [ ] For image themes: `wallpaper-terminal.webp` baked via `prep-terminal-bg.cjs` AND manifest includes `background.terminal-value` — **needs `sharp`**: run `cd ${SKILL}/scripts && npm install` first, or it exits with `sharp not installed` and no output file
- [ ] If mascots were regenerated, they came from `build-mascot.mjs` and read clearly at 24 px
- [ ] If the theme has mascots: `assets/mascot-rig.svg` present, manifest names `rig` + `idle` + `welcome` + `inquisitive` + `shocked` (never `dizzy` — the app cannot display it)
- [ ] Manifest uses relative asset paths only
- [ ] Bubble blur/opacity are manifest fields, NOT hardcoded in `custom_css`
- [ ] Wallpaper + pattern come from `background.value` / `background.pattern` — NOT from `body::before`/`body::after` in `custom_css`
- [ ] `node scripts/check-contrast.cjs <manifest.json> --fix` run — solves the ramp, writes `background.average-color`, then verifies. Must end with "All contrast checks passed."
- [ ] `preview.png` generated via `wecoded-themes/scripts/generate-previews.js <slug>` (Step 7.5) — **optional, and slow on a cold machine**: it needs a Playwright Chromium download (~150MB) that can take many minutes. If it isn't already installed, say so and offer to skip — the theme is fully usable without it (the Library card falls back to the wallpaper, and the publisher regenerates one at publish time). Do NOT silently block the build on it.
- [ ] `_preview/` deleted after successful pack creation
