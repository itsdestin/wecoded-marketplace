# docs +write

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gws-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, security rules, and **account selection** — every gws invocation must follow the routing protocol there (first-action confirm; env-var-routed config dir). If missing, run `gws generate-skills` to create it.

> **MULTI-ACCOUNT:** All `gws ...` examples below show the bare command for readability. At invocation time, prepend the env-var routing from gws-shared's Account selection section: `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR=<active configDir> GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file gws ...`.

Append text to a document

## Usage

```bash
gws docs +write --document <ID> --text <TEXT>
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--document` | ✓ | — | Document ID |
| `--text` | ✓ | — | Text to append (plain text) |

## Examples

```bash
gws docs +write --document DOC_ID --text 'Hello, world!'
```

## Tips

- Text is inserted at the end of the document body.
- For rich formatting, use the raw batchUpdate API instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a **write** command — confirm with the user before executing.
