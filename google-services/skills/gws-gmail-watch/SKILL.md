# gmail +watch

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gws-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, security rules, and **account selection** — every gws invocation must follow the routing protocol there (first-action confirm; env-var-routed config dir). If missing, run `gws generate-skills` to create it.

> **MULTI-ACCOUNT:** All `gws ...` examples below show the bare command for readability. At invocation time, prepend the env-var routing from gws-shared's Account selection section: `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR=<active configDir> GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file gws ...`.

Watch for new emails and stream them as NDJSON

## Usage

```bash
gws gmail +watch
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--project` | — | — | GCP project ID for Pub/Sub resources |
| `--subscription` | — | — | Existing Pub/Sub subscription name (skip setup) |
| `--topic` | — | — | Existing Pub/Sub topic with Gmail push permission already granted |
| `--label-ids` | — | — | Comma-separated Gmail label IDs to filter (e.g., INBOX,UNREAD) |
| `--max-messages` | — | 10 | Max messages per pull batch |
| `--poll-interval` | — | 5 | Seconds between pulls |
| `--msg-format` | — | full | Gmail message format: full, metadata, minimal, raw |
| `--once` | — | — | Pull once and exit |
| `--cleanup` | — | — | Delete created Pub/Sub resources on exit |
| `--output-dir` | — | — | Write each message to a separate JSON file in this directory |

## Examples

```bash
gws gmail +watch --project my-gcp-project
gws gmail +watch --project my-project --label-ids INBOX --once
gws gmail +watch --subscription projects/p/subscriptions/my-sub
gws gmail +watch --project my-project --cleanup --output-dir ./emails
```

## Tips

- Gmail watch expires after 7 days — re-run to renew.
- Without --cleanup, Pub/Sub resources persist for reconnection.
- Press Ctrl-C to stop gracefully.
